## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla javaScript

### What I learned
The challenge allowed me build my skill on structuring a page, and applying CSS to the structure. I was able to work on both grids and flexbox for this fun challenge. The javascript aspect was also interesting as it made me look at various scenerios users would attempt with the rating page. An additional case I thought of was allowing the user unselect a rating.


``` js 
    // A sample of a scenerio
    if (!ratingScore)
    {
        alert("Select a Rating please!")
        return ;
    }
```

### Continued development
- CSS variables is definitely an area I would want to improve on.
