## Overview

### The challenge

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned
The challenge allowed me to build my skill in structuring a page and applying CSS to the structure. I used both CSS grid and flex for the layout. The javascript aspect was also interesting as it made me look at various scenarios users would attempt with the rating page. An additional case I thought of was allowing the user to unselect a rating.


``` js 
    // A sample of a scenerio
    if (!ratingScore)
    {
        alert("Select a Rating please!")
        return ;
    }
```

### Continued development
- CSS variables are definitely an area I would want to improve on.
